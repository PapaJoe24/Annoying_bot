Hello!

This is my first real original project. If you're going to use it make sure to install the discord.py dependency 

You'll also need to make a discord bot using thier developer tool and paste the Bot Token in the BOT_TOKEN constant. 

Change CHANNEL_ID to the id of the channel you wish the bot to use to output. 

I created another constant NAME = int("user_id"), to make it easier to keep track of my friend's user ID's so I didnt mix them up.

I also added an If statement to check the user's requested and organize what user_id to use for the ping. 

******AFTER ADJUSTING ALL THE PERAMETERS*******

the command to get the bot to do what you wish follows the syntax: !ruin name number

name is replaced with the target and number is replaced with the amount of times you want the user pinged in the channel. 

HAVE FUN!!
